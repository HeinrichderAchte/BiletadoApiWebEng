# Biletado API - An API for Reservations for WebEngineering 2 Class

 The Project implements the Reservation API to run in an Kind-Cluster via Podman. Therefore "reservation" is a Pod. 

## Setup

You can download the image via the "Package" Option of GitHub.
There are also older versions available but they will therefore not work as intended.
